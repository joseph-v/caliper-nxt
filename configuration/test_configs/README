the category divides: Performance and Functional

the 'Performance' includes:
    cpu; latency(realtime); network; memory; fs; io

And the 'Function'  includes:
     cpu; commands; memory;  network(may be it need not to test? it relies on so many software);  fs;   dio

For Performance : cpu


Then for 'Performance':
    latency (process and ?)
    network (latency and bandwidth)
    memory (bandwidth and latency? not latency, the number of transfered in a period)
    cpu (mul-core-int, mul-core-float, single-core-int, sigle-core-float)
    io (bandwidth and iops)
